What is the time complexity of this

/* 
Answer: 

Binary Search Tree - is a tree in which all nodes in the left-side is less than the parent's value and all nodes 
in the right side on the contrary are greater than the value of its parent.
If a Binary tree consists of unsorted values in the worst case we'd need to iterate through each element in the tree
